Some small-to-medium size java programs I wrote

**Aloop3_Jane**                     
  A program that takes the number of a month and the start date are inputs, and outputs a calender of that month.
  
**ArrayAssign2_Jane**                          
  A program that a sequence of number as inputs, then counts each number's frequence, the mode, mean and madian of the number sequence, and outputs the results.  
  
**ArrayAssign3_Jane**                        
  A program that asks the user ten questions, then compares the answers to the correct answers, and displays some feedbacks and scores that the user get. 
  
**GraphicsQuiz_Jane**                        
  A program that displays a colourful pattern which consists circles  
  
**IOAssignment1_Jane**                     
  - PART A: Generates 20 random number from 35 to 95, prints the numbers and their average on a file named "data01.txt".
  - PART B&C: Prints the first name and last name of a student, together with four numbers from "data01" as marks on a file named "data02.txt".
  - PART D: Uses tokenizer to calculate the average for each student, and prints the results for each student on "data02".
  
**Inheritance_Jane**
  A program that asks the user to choose a geometric object (rectangle, triangle or square), calculates and displays its perimeter and area.
  *abstract class Shape: creates abstract methods
  *class Rectangle extends Shape
    *public Rectangle(double length, double width): constructors
	*public double area():returns the area of a rectangle
	*public double perimeter():returns the primeter of a rectangle
  *class Triangle extends Shape
    *public Triangle(double a, double b, double c): constructor
    *public double area(): returns the area of a triangle
    *public double perimeter(): returns the perimeter of a triangle
  *class Square extends Rectangle
    *Square(double s): constructor
    *public double area(): returns the area of a square
    *public double perimeter(): returns the perimeter of a square	
**MethodAssignment2
  A program that takes two or three numbers are inputs, and displays the maxium, minimum and midian value.
  *public static int min(int a, int b, int d): returns the minimium
  *public static int max(int a, int b, int d): returns the maximium
  *public static boolean isFinished(int a, int b, int d): determines if the user's inputs are finished
  *public static void displayValues(int a, int b, int d): displays the results
